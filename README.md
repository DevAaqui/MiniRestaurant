# MiniRestaurant

Integrated 
-> Registration of Users(Password is safe & secure and cannot be accessed by anyone)
-> Creation of restaurant over portal(Just call an API http://localhost:3000/listing-restaurant)
-> Restaurant lists show to the Users(Just call an API http://localhost:3000/all-restaurants)
-> Users can go and access the full details of the restaurant including reviews(Just call an API http://localhost:3000/full-detail/:id)

-> Do all this with the help of POSTMAN, not had enough time to create front-end but you will see the client side in coming days. I am preparing for that
