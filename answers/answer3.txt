Please write the code for the following simple and short scenarios. Please note that, in the questions below, even though a is a small array, your solution should work even if a was a big array of 1 million elements.
Q1-> Given an array const a = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4] generate an array result1 from a, which should be equal to [1, 5, 4]. The solution should be of the form: 

const a = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]

const result1 = a.filter(ele=>ele===1||ele===5||ele===4)


Q2-> Given an array const a = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]generate an array result2 from a, which should be equal to [1, 9, 25, 4, 16]. The solution should be of the form: 

const result2 = a.map((val)=> {
    return val*val
})


Q3-> Given an array const a = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]generate an array result3 from a, which should be equal to [1, 25, 16]. The solution should be of the form: 

const a = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]

const result3 = a.filter(ele=>ele===1||ele===5||ele===4).map((val)=> {
  return val*val
})
